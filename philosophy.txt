Many projects such as this try and stick to a single page, or a single
page for server, client, etc.

But this project demonstrates common/best practices for a maintained
web project so it separates code for UI, handling the web firmata
protocol, stylesheets, etc.

It also makes use of standard development and deployment tools such
as npm, bower, etc.

It can be used as a starting template for other projects, or components
taken out and re-used.
